# Teleport Zoom
Want to be zoomed to outerspace for a specific teleport, but be able to see your character for other teleports? Look no further.
<br><br>This plugin allows you to set specific zooms at given teleports, for scopes sake at current standing this just uses the region, so if two teleports are within the same region only one zoom can be set for said region.
# Saving a new Zoom
Teleport to a location and press the "**Save Zoom**" hotkey(default: ctrl-shift-insert)
# Removing an existing Zoom
Teleport to a location and press the "**Delete Zoom**" hotkey(default: ctrl-shift-delete)
